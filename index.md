## Intro

### Supervised & Unsupervised Machine Learning
Supervised Machine Learning: 
right answers are given--
1. regression(predict house price, target variable is continuous)
2. classifcation problem(breast cancer malignant or benign, target varible is discrete)

Unsupervised Machine Learning: 
find structures in data sets--
1. clustering (link similar news together,organize computing clusters, market segmentation)
2. unclustering (cocktail party problem(去杂音))

### Model Representation
notations:
1. m: number of training examples
2. x's: input
3. y's: output
4. (x, y): one training example
5. (x^i, y^i): i th training example
6. h: h maps x's to y's
